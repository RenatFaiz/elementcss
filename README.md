Not familiar with github.com or git? To learn more about git go [here (official documentation)](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) or just googling "learn git". If you are newbie who often face the git and github.com, but you don't even know what the difference between them. Here is useful quote:

> Git is a revision control system, a tool to manage your source code history. GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories. So they are not the same thing: Git the tool, GitHub the service for projects that uses Git.
